# Architecture graph check

`graph_check.py` builds Loom's named-module import graph from `src/` and
enforces the invariants of RFC 0001 (see
[`docs/rfcs/0001-module-architecture-target.md`](../../docs/rfcs/0001-module-architecture-target.md)).
It runs in CI on every `src/` change (`.github/workflows/arch-check.yml`)
and has zero third-party dependencies.

## Gates

**Current-state gate (default):**

1. the module-level graph is a DAG (Tarjan SCC);
2. no *new* non-contract upward edge versus `upward_edge_baseline.txt`;
3. no *new* dead import versus `dead_imports_baseline.txt`.

Both baselines are frozen snapshots of known backlog. **Additions fail;
removals are always allowed** and shrink the snapshot as cleanup lands.
Useful outputs while developing:

```bash
python3 tools/arch/graph_check.py             # human-readable
python3 tools/arch/graph_check.py --json      # machine-readable
python3 tools/arch/graph_check.py --target-core8   # future-state Phase B gate
python3 tools/arch/graph_check.py --target-ui9     # RFC 0002 F0 future-state gate
```

**Future-state gate (`--target-core8`):** the nine RFC 0001 target areas
must be pairwise acyclic (nine singleton SCCs). It fails today and becomes
the Phase B completion gate after the 14 cut families land.

**Future-state gate (`--target-ui9`, RFC 0002 phase F0):** the twelve
`cc.ui.<area>` areas must be pairwise acyclic (twelve singleton SCCs), and
no NEW back direction may appear under the declared 12-area total order
(`UI9_RANK` in `graph_check.py`). Two frozen sets in
`ui_back_edge_baseline.txt`, two checks:

1. **Tarjan + subset freeze** — the SCC-internal area-directions are frozen
   at 19 (17 in the 7-area SCC + 2 chrome↔foundation); a 20th fails. This is
   the sole guard for `cc.ui`-internal edges: the default rank gate is blind
   to them (`cc.ui` is one rank-12 area in `TARGET_RANK`).
2. **Rank-based order conformance** — a direction `A -> B` with
   `rank(A) < rank(B)` is a back edge; the 5 live back directions (7 module
   edges) are baselined, and ANY other upward edge fails — including a
   non-SCC-forming one (e.g. `visual -> foundation` passes check 1 — visual
   is a singleton — but fails check 2). After F2 severs all 5, this enforces
   0 upward edges, machine-enforcing the declared total order.

It fails today (2 SCCs) and passes after the RFC 0002 F1/F2 cuts land.
Additions fail; removals shrink the snapshot. The negative test
(`test_target_ui9.py`, run manually — no Python test runner is wired in this
repo) covers the live-tree failure and both synthetic-new-edge cases:

```bash
python3 tools/arch/test_target_ui9.py
```

## What counts as an upward edge

`TARGET_RANK` gives the total layer order; `MODULE_RANK_OVERRIDE` covers
leaf modules that physically live inside a higher-level area directory.
An edge from a lower-rank area/module to a higher one is illegal unless
the imported module is a structural **contract**: named `*.port` /
`*.contract`, `*_types`, or under `cc.types.*`. Extra contracts are
listed one per line in `port_allowlist.txt`.

## Dead-import detection

An import is reported when none of the imported module's exported names
(types, functions, namespace-scope variables, enumerators, namespace
paths) are referenced in the importing file. The analysis is textual but
guards against common false matches:

- names shadowed by a local declaration do not count;
- `::name` / `.name` qualified or member accesses do not count (genuine
  namespace-qualified uses are matched via the full `cc::...` path or a
  relative `seg::` after a using-namespace);
- `export import` re-exports are never dead.

An intentional import with no textual reference (ADL/operator overload
participation, user-defined literals via `operator""_x`, explicit
ordering requirement) is silenced on the import line:

```cpp
import cc.foo.overloads;  // arch-check: keep-import
```

or on its own line above the import, or file-wide with
`// arch-check: keep-imports`. When a dead import is real, **delete it**
(prefer deleting dead code — project convention).

### Known limits of the textual analysis

The check is deliberately fail-on-addition, so residual imprecision can
only block a genuinely new import — never silently allow a violation.
Known cases where a *required* import may be flagged (use the keep-import
marker):

- ADL-only overload/operator participation and user-defined literals
  (`operator""_x`) that are never named textually;
- `export using ... ;` re-export shapes (none live today);
- aliases targeting area-level namespaces;
- names mentioned only in trailing comments or string literals still
  count as use (false-negative bias — a few real dead imports may be
  missed; tightening requires a fresh compile-verified snapshot).

Module/import *edges* have no such blind spots: extraction runs on
comment-stripped, backslash-newline-spliced text with multiline regexes,
so newlines/comments inside a declaration cannot hide an edge, and an
unknown area fails the gate rather than skipping its edges.

## Refreshing a baseline

After deliberately cleaning up (or, rarely, accepting a sanctioned new
exception), regenerate:

```bash
python3 tools/arch/graph_check.py --json \
  | python3 -c 'import json,sys; [print(a+" -> "+b) for a,b in json.load(sys.stdin)["illegal_upward_edges"]]' \
  > tools/arch/upward_edge_baseline.txt
python3 tools/arch/graph_check.py --json \
  | python3 -c 'import json,sys; [print(a+" -> "+b) for a,b in json.load(sys.stdin)["dead_imports"]]' \
  > tools/arch/dead_imports_baseline.txt
```

Impl-unit entries are keyed `module [impl:src/relative/path.cpp]`, so
sibling TUs never share a verdict.

Baselines are reviewed in the PR that changes them; they must never be
regenerated to silence an accidental new coupling.

## Inline-definition ratchet (RFC 0001 Phase C)

`inline_def_check.py` counts the **semantic** inline definitions (named
function/method/operator/ctor/dtor bodies at namespace or class scope; no
lambdas, control blocks, function-local classes, or data members) in each
module **interface** unit (`.cppm`; module impl `.cpp` units are exempt —
bodies belong there). It enforces `inline_def_baseline.txt`:

1. **Fail on increase.** A frozen module whose count rises above its
   snapshot fails. Bodies moving into impl units *shrink* the count;
   re-freeze in the same commit with `--update`.
2. **Fail closed for new god interfaces.** An unlisted interface over the
   C2 cap (100) fails — one cannot grow a new god interface unnoticed.
3. **Graduation flags.** `c2-done` enforces ≤100; `c1` enforces <30 for
   the six RFC 0001 C1 modules once each split merges.
4. **Phase D layout (RFC 0001).** A `cc.utils.*` interface placed flat
   directly in `src/utils/` fails — modules live in a domain subdirectory
   `src/utils/<area>/` while their module names stay `cc.utils.*`.
   Frozen per-module exceptions live in `flat_utils_exceptions.txt`.

```bash
python3 tools/arch/inline_def_check.py            # enforce
python3 tools/arch/inline_def_check.py --json     # machine-readable
python3 tools/arch/inline_def_check.py --update   # re-freeze after a split
```

A body that must deliberately stay inline is exempted with a marker on
its signature line: `// arch-check: keep-inline`.

## Producer BMI / PSS measurement (RFC 0001 Phase E)

`measure_bmi.py` compiles one module interface TU with its exact
`compile_commands.json` argv + `@*.modmap` and records the producer
cost reproducibly (it supersedes the ad-hoc `/tmp` scratch scripts used
in early phases):

- **`pss_peak_kb`** — peak **PSS** (proportional set size) read from
  `/proc/<pid>/smaps_rollup` while the compiler runs. PSS is the RFC
  memory metric; RSS is recorded only as `rss_max_kb_secondary` for
  cross-checking. Polling at a fixed interval gives a lower bound on
  the true peak.
- **`bmi_bytes`** — bytes of the emitted reduced BMI (the modmap's
  `-fmodule-output=*.pcm`). Across ~N importers this is the fan-out
  cost; compare kB/ratios, not exact bytes (PCMs carry small timestamp
  noise).
- **`object_bytes`** and **producer wall time**.

```bash
# configure once so compile_commands.json + .modmap + prerequisite PCMs exist
cmake --build --preset local-linux

# human-readable
python3 tools/arch/measure_bmi.py src/query/query_engine.cppm
python3 tools/arch/measure_bmi.py mcp/client.cppm        # unique path suffix
python3 tools/arch/measure_bmi.py --runs 3 --interval-ms 10 query_engine
python3 tools/arch/measure_bmi.py --mode ninja --force query_engine

# machine-readable, written to a file for before/after evidence
python3 tools/arch/measure_bmi.py --json --out /tmp/before.json src/...
```

`<source>` accepts a repo-relative path, a unique path suffix
(`mcp/client.cppm` disambiguates the three `client.cppm` files), or a
unique basename/stem (`query_engine`); an ambiguous shorthand exits 2
and lists the candidates.

Canonical **pre/post** recipe for a body-extraction batch (same box,
same preset, no concurrent ninja/ctest):

```bash
python3 tools/arch/measure_bmi.py --json --out /tmp/before.json <mod>
# … make the split, rebuild …
python3 tools/arch/measure_bmi.py --json --out /tmp/after.json  <mod>
ninja -C build/debug   # restore the canonical object/BMI afterward
```

`--mode direct` (default) execs the compile argv with the build dir as
cwd and samples the producer PID directly; `--mode ninja` rebuilds the
target through `ninja` (no `-j` is ever passed — default parallelism is
preserved) and sums matching `clang++` PIDs, useful when prerequisite
PCMs must be rebuilt first.

**Linux-only.** On non-Linux the tool exits `3`: PSS has no
`/proc` equivalent, and RSS must not be substituted. macos-14 evidence
is the CI build/step wall time at default Ninja parallelism. This tool
is deliberately **not** run in `arch-check.yml` (that workflow stays a
fast, Linux static-lint gate).
